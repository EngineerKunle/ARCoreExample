# ARCoreExample

This is an AR app, based on Google AR Core SDK.
 
The App will be mostly written in Java but there are few classes built
with Kotlin.


## Update

ARCore 1.0 is out now and development will stop as most classes don't work and documentation
has been removed or updated for those classes ...please see my other repositories to see my work on ARCore.
